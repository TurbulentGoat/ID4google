## Online Safety Code Changes - December 27th

On December 27th, 2025, new compliance measures under Australia's Online Safety Code will come into effect for internet search engine services. They say this is to protect Australian children, but it's just another method of controlling people and gathering data.

These changes specifically address:

- Class 1C and Class 2 Material: Enhanced safety measures for content that may expose Australian children to harmful material
- Search Engine Responsibilities: New obligations for internet search engine providers to implement protective measures
- Content Filtering: Stricter requirements around filtering and blocking access to inappropriate content for minors
